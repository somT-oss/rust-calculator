# Rust-Calculator
This is a calcultor CLI application built with rust. I built it as a beginner project to help understand Rust data types, functions and a bit of how structs work.

For developers that are new to the Rust programming language like me, they can learn from this project by just reading through the code to understand how the logic was built. UNderstanding code written by other developers improves your overall growth as a developer.

### How to get Started
Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/somT-oss/rust-calculator.git
```

Go to the src directory:
```
cd /project_one
```

Open your terminal enter the ```cargo run``` command like so:
```
cargo run
